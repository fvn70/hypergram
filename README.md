JBA JS project <b>Hypergram</b>

For every photographer, the process of creating an image does not end after pressing the shutter button. You will always be pressed by the need to tweak the photos a little bit to make them look like how you've conceived them. In most cases, the process of retouching a photo is not as easy as many would want to imagine. 
This is a simple app that can help you with image editing!
